# Grace Candy Shopper (eCommerce Project)

We built a PERN full stack eCommerce candy shop website in a 10-day sprint. Familiar? Yes, as for the design, we mimiced an existing candy shop as we all happened to be candy lovers. 

We are proud of this project as this was our first group project putting into the stacks we have learned in such a short amount of time.
